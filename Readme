Great! To truly understand React Hooks, the best way is to build something practical. 
Here’s a progressive challenge that will make you master each Hook step by step.

🚀 React Hooks Mastery Challenge

🏆 Final Goal: Build a Task Manager App with Hooks

You’ll create a Task Manager where users can add, edit, delete, filter, and persist tasks.

Hooks you’ll use:
✅ useState → Manage tasks
✅ useEffect → Store tasks in local storage
✅ useContext → Create a theme switcher
✅ useReducer → Manage complex task operations

📝 Step-by-Step Challenges

🔹 Challenge 1: Master useState – Create a Task List

✅ Goal: Build a simple task list where users can add and remove tasks.

Steps:
	1.	Create a React app with Vite or Create React App.->done
	2.	Use useState to store an array of tasks.->done
	3.	Add an input field to enter a new task.->done
	4.	Add a button to add tasks to the list.->done
	5.	Display all tasks in a list.
	6.	Add a “Delete” button next to each task to remove it.

Hints:
	•	Use useState([]) for tasks.
	•	Use setTasks([...tasks, newTask]) to add a task.
	•	Use setTasks(tasks.filter(task => task.id !== id)) to delete a task.

🔹 Bonus: Add a checkbox to mark tasks as completed.

🔹 Challenge 2: Master useEffect – Save Tasks in Local Storage

✅ Goal: Save tasks in localStorage so they persist after refreshing.

Steps:
	1.	Use useEffect to load tasks from localStorage when the app starts.
	2.	Save tasks in localStorage every time they change.

Hints:
	•	localStorage.setItem("tasks", JSON.stringify(tasks))
	•	const storedTasks = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("tasks")) || []
	•	Use useEffect(() => {...}, [tasks]) to save tasks on every update.

🔹 Bonus: Show a message like “All tasks saved!” when saving.

🔹 Challenge 3: Master useContext – Add a Dark/Light Theme

✅ Goal: Allow users to toggle between dark and light modes.

Steps:
	1.	Create a ThemeContext.
	2.	Use useContext in components to access the theme.
	3.	Add a toggle button to switch between themes.

Hints:
	•	const ThemeContext = createContext("light")
	•	useContext(ThemeContext) to access the theme.
	•	Store theme in localStorage so it persists.

🔹 Bonus: Change the background color based on the theme.

🔹 Challenge 4: Master useReducer – Implement Task Filters & Edits

✅ Goal: Improve state management using useReducer instead of useState.

Steps:
	1.	Convert useState tasks into useReducer.
	2.	Create actions: ADD_TASK, REMOVE_TASK, TOGGLE_TASK, EDIT_TASK.
	3.	Implement an edit button next to each task.
	4.	Implement a filter to show:
	•	✅ Completed Tasks
	•	❌ Incomplete Tasks
	•	🔄 All Tasks

Hints:
	•	Create a reducer function like this:

function taskReducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "ADD_TASK":
      return [...state, action.payload];
    case "REMOVE_TASK":
      return state.filter(task => task.id !== action.payload);
    case "TOGGLE_TASK":
      return state.map(task =>
        task.id === action.payload ? { ...task, completed: !task.completed } : task
      );
    case "EDIT_TASK":
      return state.map(task =>
        task.id === action.payload.id ? { ...task, text: action.payload.text } : task
      );
    default:
      return state;
  }
}


	•	Use const [tasks, dispatch] = useReducer(taskReducer, initialTasks);

🔹 Bonus: Add animations when adding or removing tasks.

🔹 Final Challenge: Bring Everything Together! 🎯

✅ Goal: Make your Task Manager App fully functional.

Features to Implement:

✅ Add and remove tasks using useState or useReducer.
✅ Save tasks in local storage using useEffect.
✅ Add a dark mode toggle using useContext.
✅ Implement filters and edits using useReducer.

🚀 Extra Challenge (For Experts!)

✅ Integrate a Backend: Use Firebase or an Express.js API to store tasks online.
✅ Use Custom Hooks: Create a useLocalStorage Hook to handle local storage logic.
